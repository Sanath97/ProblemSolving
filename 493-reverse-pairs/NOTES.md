**Approaches**
1. Basic bruteforce approach would be to do a nested comparison of each element with all elements on its right and count pairs that satisfy the given condition. Space is constant but time complexity would be O(n^2)
2. Optimal solution is a variant of merge sort. During the merge functionality we count number of pairs by taking advantage that array on left and right are sorted.

Be cautious with conditions in code. More probable to make mistakes in writing conditions.
